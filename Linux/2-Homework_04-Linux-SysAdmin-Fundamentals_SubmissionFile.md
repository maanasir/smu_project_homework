## Week 4 Homework Submission File: Linux Systems Administration

### Step 1: Ensure/Double Check Permissions on Sensitive Files

1. Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l shadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): chmod g-r shadow

2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l gshadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): chmod g-r gshadow

3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l group

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): chmod 644 group

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l passwd

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): chmod 644 passwd

### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users): 
    
    sudo useradd sam
    sudo useradd joe
    sudo useradd amy
    sudo useradd sara
    sudo useradd admin


2. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group: usermod -aG sudo admin

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group: sudo groupadd engineers

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users): 

    sudo usermod -aG engineers sam
    sudo usermod -aG engineers joe
    sudo usermod -aG engineers amy
    sudo usermod -aG engineers sara
   

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder: 

    mkdir /home/engineers/sharedfolder

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group: 

    chgrp engineers sharedfolder 

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis: sudo apt install lynis 

2. Command to see documentation and instructions: man lynis

3. Command to run an audit: sudo lynis audit system

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.

    - Screenshot of report output:
